        finances, but also allows it to raise share capital from ordinary investors on the 
        share market. Investors to a limited company are also limited in their liability to
        the company to the value of their unpaid shares.\n
        Proprietary - an unlimited in liability but privately held company. Very uncommon.\n
        Incorporated - not specifically company structures but an entity entitled to an 
        ABN. May consist of other structures such as a body corporate, an incorporated association,
        or more frequently a foreign company [as 'inc' is an American suffix].\n  
        No Liability - a company type only available to certain types of mining ventures.
        Investors who commit to buying shares are never required to pay for them. Was 
        invented to allow for companies who do speculative mining exploration and to make it
        more appealing to potential investors to invest."

The sole exception to this is Norfolk Island between 1979 and 2015, and the associated jurisdiction of the Coral Sea between these times."
